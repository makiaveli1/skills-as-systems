# Evaluation and release evidence

## Evaluation philosophy

Skill quality is behavioral. A package can have valid YAML and still route badly, load too much, invent authority, or reward plausible-looking failure.

The suite therefore uses several independent layers. Each layer supports different claims.

## Gate 1: package integrity

Repository validation checks:

- required files and canonical directory names;
- Agent Skills frontmatter and description length;
- compact-core line and approximate token budgets;
- direct relative link integrity;
- package versions and host metadata;
- absence of repository-only READMEs inside skill packages;
- absence of generated builds, browser profiles, logs, caches, credentials, and machine-specific paths;
- package size ceilings;
- Claude marketplace and plugin structure;
- Codex project-discovery links.

This proves structural readiness, not task quality.

## Gate 2: skill-specific regression suites

### SITECRAFT

The suite exercises contracts, cross-artifact drift, portable workspace creation, image and video production graphs, responsive/platform evidence, capability ownership, handoff authority, learning promotion, and provider-neutral routing.

Important negative properties include:

- builds do not prove visuals;
- screenshots do not prove interaction or accessibility;
- generated media providers are optional;
- public packages do not contain active provider configuration;
- host capabilities do not become experience requirements;
- handoffs carry no permissions, secrets, or hidden reasoning.

### FOUNDRY

The suite exercises system maps, change contracts, verification receipts, continuation records, routing scenarios, project identity, evidence classes, dependency links, carried authority, and invalid mutations.

Important adversarial properties include:

- coding before understanding;
- weakening tests to get green output;
- generated-file edits;
- version and environment assumptions;
- fake performance and security claims;
- broad exception swallowing;
- unsafe migrations and concurrency neglect;
- completion claims wider than the evidence.

## Gate 3: routing

Routing tests operate at two levels:

1. **skill activation:** which of SITECRAFT or FOUNDRY should activate;
2. **internal paging:** which compact and specialist references should load.

Cases include:

- clear positive triggers;
- explicit negative requests;
- adjacent-domain ambiguity;
- multi-skill tasks;
- negated keywords;
- provider names that must not broaden generic routes;
- large tasks that should load compacts before deep atlases.

Automated routing data checks structure and expected boundaries. Model-level activation remains a host evaluation because different hosts use different retrieval systems.

## Gate 4: artifact mutations

A valid example is necessary but weak: it can pass while the validator ignores important fields.

Mutation tests deliberately introduce invalid states, including:

- mismatched project or contract identity;
- a passing verdict with unverified required claims;
- dangling evidence, risk, dependency, or capability references;
- a continuation record that carries permissions;
- stale downstream state after an upstream decision changes;
- unsupported cultural certainty or reviewer scope;
- missing rollback or recovery information where required.

The test passes only when the invalid artifact fails for the intended reason.

## Gate 5: clean installation

`scripts/smoke_install.py` creates temporary projects and installs both skills into:

- Codex project scope: `.agents/skills/<name>`;
- Claude Code project scope: `.claude/skills/<name>`.

It then verifies package identity, file completeness, frontmatter names, and byte-for-byte `SKILL.md` equality with the source.

This is an installation-layout test. It does not claim a live Codex or Claude session invoked the skill.

## Gate 6: representative work

Release candidates should be exercised against tasks such as:

### SITECRAFT

- frame a new product experience from a sparse brief;
- repair a visually broken existing site without rewriting it;
- audit responsive behavior, accessibility, and release evidence;
- create a generated-media plan with fallbacks and spend boundaries;
- reject a visually impressive but incoherent or unverified result.

### FOUNDRY

- explain an unfamiliar repository and its behavioral path;
- add a small feature without an unnecessary rewrite;
- debug an environment-versus-code failure;
- repair a concurrency defect;
- perform a safe migration;
- review a risky change;
- recover from interrupted or concurrent work;
- catch green unit tests masking broken integration.

The receiving model and host version, supplied context, tools, exact prompt, output, evaluator, and evidence should be recorded.

## Release receipt

A public release should state:

- package versions and commit;
- structural validator result;
- skill suite results;
- official Agent Skills validator result;
- clean-install smoke result;
- Claude plugin validation result when Claude Code is available;
- representative host/scenario results actually run;
- unverified platforms or behaviors;
- known compatibility and migration risks.

Never collapse these into “all tests passed.”

## What the current automated suite does not prove

It does not by itself prove:

- every Codex or Claude model will route identically;
- visual quality in a real browser;
- production security, performance, or reliability;
- PC Bridge behavior in an unavailable runtime;
- absence of all legal, cultural, or operational risk.

Those claims require their own observations, reviewers, environments, and evidence.
