# Portability: one core, discovered hosts

## Quick installation

### Ask the receiving agent

```text
Install SITECRAFT and FOUNDRY from https://github.com/makiaveli1/skills-as-systems for this harness. Prefer its native skill or plugin installer; otherwise use the repository's portable installer. Verify both skills are discoverable and report the exact installed paths. Do not add permissions or external integrations.
```

### Codex user install

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/makiaveli1/skills-as-systems.git && python3 skills-as-systems/scripts/install.py codex
```

### Claude Code plugin install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add makiaveli1/skills-as-systems && claude plugin install skills-as-systems@skills-as-systems
```

### Existing checkout

```bash
python3 scripts/install.py codex
python3 scripts/install.py claude
python3 scripts/install.py --target /custom/skill/root
```

The first two commands install both skills at user scope. Use the advanced options below only when you need project scope, one skill, a custom target, replacement, or symlinks.

## Portable by construction

The canonical packages under `skills/` use the open Agent Skills shape:

```text
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
├── assets/
├── schemas/
├── scripts/
├── examples/
└── tests/
```

Only `SKILL.md` is required by the standard. The additional resources provide progressive depth, reusable artifacts, and validation.

The portable core assumes only that a capable agent can read the supplied text. It does not assume:

- a particular model or provider;
- shell access;
- Python execution;
- a browser, audio, image, or runtime tool;
- network access;
- a logged-in account;
- permission to write or publish;
- PC Bridge.

When a capability is missing, the skill reports the resulting limitation and can produce a bounded packet for another host or human.

## Canonical versus adapter material

The repository separates three concerns:

| Concern | Location | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Portable doctrine and references | `skills/<name>/` | No provider-only authority or invocation behavior |
| Codex interface metadata | `skills/<name>/agents/openai.yaml` | Presentation and invocation policy only |
| Claude distribution | `.claude-plugin/` | Marketplace and plugin packaging only |

PC Bridge manifests live in each skill because they describe optional routing and staged validation, but the skills do not require PC Bridge to operate.

Repository documentation, release notes, development fixtures, captures, generated sites, browser profiles, and private workspaces stay outside canonical skill directories.

## Codex

Codex discovers skills from `.agents/skills` at user or project scope. The repository supports both approaches:

- `.agents/skills/` contains relative links for use while working in this repository;
- `scripts/install.py --host codex` copies canonical packages into a user or project skill directory;
- every package contains optional `agents/openai.yaml` metadata for display name, concise description, default prompt, and safe implicit activation.

The canonical `SKILL.md` descriptions are front-loaded because Codex may shorten descriptions when the initial skill catalog approaches its context budget.

No skill declares that a tool is allowed. Codex permissions remain Codex and user policy.

## Claude Code

Claude Code can discover standalone skills from `~/.claude/skills` or `.claude/skills`, and it can distribute them through plugins.

This repository is a single marketplace plugin containing both canonical skill directories. The wrapper does not duplicate their instructions.

The canonical frontmatter avoids Claude-only fields such as invocation disabling, forked context, argument hints, and pre-approved tools. Those fields can be useful for a host-specific skill, but placing them in the shared core would change behavior elsewhere.

The compact cores also stay below Claude's recommended `SKILL.md` size and compaction boundaries. Deep references load only when needed.

## Generic Agent Skills hosts

Copy a complete directory from `skills/` into the host's configured skill location. The package name must remain the same as the frontmatter `name`.

If the host does not understand `agents/openai.yaml` or `pc-bridge.skill.json`, it can ignore them. The operating instructions remain in `SKILL.md` and relative resources.

## Installer behavior

The dependency-free installer supports:

```text
python3 scripts/install.py codex
python3 scripts/install.py claude --scope project --project /path/to/project
python3 scripts/install.py --target /custom/skill/root --skill sitecraft
```

Safety behavior:

- the default mode copies files, which works across operating systems;
- it installs only known skill directories;
- it refuses to replace an existing target by default;
- `--replace` moves the existing skill to a timestamped sibling backup before installation;
- `--dry-run` prints the exact plan without writing;
- `--mode symlink` is available for local development;
- it never edits host settings, installs plugins, configures MCP, or authenticates providers.

## Updating

For marketplace installs, use Claude Code's marketplace update flow.

For copied installs:

1. fetch or download the new repository version;
2. inspect release changes;
3. run the repository validation;
4. reinstall with `--replace` to retain a recoverable backup;
5. restart or reload the receiving host if required.

Do not merge two package versions by copying individual reference files. Schemas, examples, validators, and routing manifests evolve together.

## Removing

Remove only the exact installed skill directory from the host's configured skill root. If `--replace` created a backup, it remains beside the installed directory until the user intentionally removes it.

The installer does not provide an uninstall command because deletion policy belongs to the user and host.

## Host evidence

Compatibility claims have scope:

- **structural:** the package matches the documented host directory and metadata shape;
- **installation smoke:** a clean temporary Codex or Claude directory receives complete packages;
- **plugin validation:** Claude Code accepts the marketplace/plugin metadata;
- **activation:** the host discovers and invokes the intended skill;
- **behavioral:** the host uses the correct route and produces compliant work.

This repository automates the first two. Plugin and behavioral tests should be recorded against the exact host and version used.
