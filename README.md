Portable Agent Skills by **MAKIAVELI**.

- **SITECRAFT** helps agents plan, design, build, repair, audit, and release web experiences.
- **FOUNDRY** helps agents understand, change, debug, review, test, and recover software systems.

> A skill should not be a giant prompt. It should be a small, testable operating system for judgment.

Both skills follow the open [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). They do not require PC Bridge, Codex, Claude Code, or any particular model provider.

## Install in under a minute

### Easiest: ask your agent

Paste this into a capable coding agent:

```text
Install SITECRAFT and FOUNDRY from https://github.com/makiaveli1/skills-as-systems for this harness at user scope. Prefer the harness's native skill or plugin installer. Otherwise clone the repository and use its portable installer. Verify that both skills are discoverable, report their exact installed paths, and tell me whether a reload or restart is needed. Do not add tool permissions or configure external services.
```

### Codex

Paste this into Codex:

```text
$skill-installer Install sitecraft and foundry-engineering from https://github.com/makiaveli1/skills-as-systems for my user account. Verify both appear in the skill picker or /skills, report their installed paths, and tell me if Codex needs a restart.
```

Or use one terminal line:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/makiaveli1/skills-as-systems.git && python3 skills-as-systems/scripts/install.py codex
```

Codex loads user skills from `$HOME/.agents/skills`. See the official [Codex skills documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/).

### Claude Code

Use one terminal line:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add makiaveli1/skills-as-systems && claude plugin install skills-as-systems@skills-as-systems
```

Or paste this into Claude Code:

```text
Add makiaveli1/skills-as-systems as a plugin marketplace, install the skills-as-systems plugin, reload plugins if requested, and verify that sitecraft and foundry-engineering are available.
```

See the official [Claude Code marketplace documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces).

### Another Agent Skills host

Ask the agent to copy either complete directory from `skills/` into its configured skill location. Keep the directory name unchanged. For a local checkout, you can also run:

```bash
python3 scripts/install.py --target /path/to/your/skills
```

For project-only installation, advanced replacement, symlink, and removal guidance, see [Portability and installation](docs/portability.md).

## Use the skills

### SITECRAFT

Codex:

```text
$sitecraft Build this product brief into a distinctive responsive website, then verify the important states.
```

Claude Code plugin:

```text
/skills-as-systems:sitecraft Audit this website's visual hierarchy, responsiveness, accessibility, and release evidence.
```

### FOUNDRY

Codex:

```text
$foundry-engineering Map this unfamiliar repository, trace the failing behavior, make the smallest safe fix, and prove it works.
```

Claude Code plugin:

```text
/skills-as-systems:foundry-engineering Review this change for behavioral, compatibility, security, and migration risk.
```

Capable hosts can also activate either skill automatically when the request matches its description.

## Choose the right skill

| Skill | Version | Use it for | Central artifact |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| [SITECRAFT](docs/sitecraft.md) | 0.3.0 | Websites, web applications, responsive experience, visual systems, interaction, accessibility, and release evidence | Experience Contract |
| [FOUNDRY](docs/foundry.md) | 0.2.0 | Codebase understanding, implementation, debugging, testing, review, architecture, migrations, reliability, security, and performance | Change Contract |

Use both when a task changes a web experience and the software system behind it.

## What makes these different

Each skill separates six jobs that ordinary prompts often mix together:

1. **Route:** decide whether the skill applies and which part is needed.
2. **Understand:** inspect the real project or problem before producing work.
3. **Contract:** record what should change, what must remain true, and what owns the decision.
4. **Act:** make the smallest coherent intervention.
5. **Verify:** match every completion claim to appropriate evidence.
6. **Continue:** leave compact state another agent or human can safely resume.

Detailed specialist references load only when needed. Failure tests target plausible-looking mistakes such as unnecessary rewrites, guessed capabilities, weakened tests, unsupported visual claims, and fake completion.

Read [the architecture](docs/architecture.md) for the complete model or [the evaluation guide](docs/evaluation.md) for what the test suite does and does not prove.

## Portable core, optional adapters

The canonical packages live under `skills/`. Their doctrine and references are provider-neutral.

- `agents/openai.yaml` adds optional Codex presentation metadata.
- `.claude-plugin/` packages both skills for Claude Code distribution.
- `pc-bridge.skill.json` describes optional PC Bridge routing and staged validation.

None of these files grants permission to use tools, write files, deploy, spend money, or access accounts. The receiving host and user remain the authority.

## A glimpse of PC Bridge

**MAKIAVELI** is also developing **PC Bridge**, an optional control plane for serious agent work. The idea is simple: skills provide domain knowledge and procedure; PC Bridge provides guarded project boundaries, durable work identity, compiled context, authority, effects, evidence, coordination, verification, and continuity.

PC Bridge is not required by SITECRAFT or FOUNDRY, and this brief description is not an API stability promise.

## Validate the repository

Run the complete repository checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_repository.py && python3 scripts/smoke_install.py
```

GitHub Actions also validates both packages, the installer, routing fixtures, and clean Codex and Claude directory layouts on every push.

## Repository map

```text

.agents/skills/         Codex project-discovery links
.claude-plugin/         Claude Code marketplace metadata

## Contributing and security

Contributions should make a skill more correct, portable, discriminating, verifiable, or context-efficient. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Report security problems using [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Do not publish credentials, private project data, or production artifacts in an issue.
